Security Advisories can be found at: [https://github.com/vmware/photon/wiki/Security-Advisories](https://github.com/vmware/photon/wiki/Security-Advisories)


If you use Photon OS 4.0, the security advisories for the updated RPMs are available in the respective repositories through the `updateinfo` option in the `tdnf` command. To see the entire list of the security advisories, enable both the repositories. 

**Notes**: The number of security advisories that you see in the message of the day is only for the enabled repository and might not refer to the total number of advisories.
