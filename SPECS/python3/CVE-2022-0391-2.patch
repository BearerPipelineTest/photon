+The presence of newline or tab characters in parts of a URL allows for some
+forms of attacks. Following the WHATWG specification that updates RFC 3986,
+ASCII newline ``\n``, ``\r`` and tab ``\t`` characters are stripped from the
+URL by the parser :func:`urllib.parse` preventing such attacks. The removal
+characters are controlled by a new module level variable
+``urllib.parse._UNSAFE_URL_BYTES_TO_REMOVE``. (See :issue:`43882`)
